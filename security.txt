Which of the following authentication methods is considered to be the LEAST secure?
A. TOTP
B. SMS
C. HOTP
D. Token key
Answer: B
Explanation: 
SMS-based authentication is considered to be the least secure among the given options. This is because SMS messages can be intercepted or redirected by attackers through techniques such as SIM swapping, man-in-the-middle attacks, or exploiting weaknesses in the SS7 protocol used by mobile networks. Additionally, SMS messages can be compromised if a user's phone is lost, stolen, or infected with malware. In contrast, TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password), and token keys are more secure as they rely on cryptographic algorithms or physical devices to generate one-time use codes, which are less susceptible to interception or unauthorized access.

A security analyst is reviewing the vulnerability scan report for a web server following an incident. The vulnerability that was used to exploit the server is present in historical vulnerability scan reports, and a patch is available for the vulnerability. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?
A. Security patches were uninstalled due to user impact.
B. An adversary altered the vulnerability scan reports
C. A zero-day vulnerability was used to exploit the web server
D. The scan reported a false negative for the vulnerability
Answer: A
Explanation: 
A security patch is a software update that fixes a vulnerability or bug that could be exploited by attackers. Security patches are essential for maintaining the security and functionality of systems and applications.
If the vulnerability that was used to exploit the server is present in historical vulnerability scan reports, and a patch is available for the vulnerability, it means that the patch was either not applied or was uninstalled at some point. A possible reason for uninstalling a security patch could be user impact, such as performance degradation, compatibility issues, or functionality loss. The other options are not correct because:
• B. An adversary altered the vulnerability scan reports. This could be a possibility, but it is less likely than option A. An adversary would need to have access tothe vulnerability scan reports and be able to modify them without being detected. Moreover, altering the reports would not prevent the patch from being applied or uninstalled.
 C. A zero-day vulnerability was used to exploit the web server. This is not correct because a zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability that is unknown to the public or the vendor, and therefore has no patch available. The question states that a patch is available for the vulnerability that was used to exploit the server.
• D. The scan reported a false negative for the vulnerability. This is not correct because a false negative is when a scan fails to detect a vulnerability that ispresent. The question states that the vulnerability is present in historical vulnerability scan reports, which means that it was detected by previous scans.
According to CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Objectives 1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack:
"A security patch is a software update that fixes a vulnerability or bug that could be exploited by attackers."

Answer: B
Explanation: 
DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing or DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System (DNS) data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, such as an IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other malicious destination).
DNS poisoning can be performed by various methods, such as:
 Intercepting and forging DNS responses from legitimate servers
 Compromising DNS servers and altering their records
 Exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS protocols or implementations
 Sending malicious emails or links that trigger DNS queries with poisoned responses According to CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Objectives 1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack:

Which of the following BEST describes the attack the company is experiencing?
A. MAC flooding
B. URL redirection
C. ARP poisoning
D. DNS hijacking
Answer: C
Explanation: 
The output of the "netstat -ano" command shows that there are two connections to the same IP address and port number. This indicates that there are two active sessions between the client and server.
The issue of users having to provide their credentials twice to log in is known as a double login prompt issue. This issue can occur due to various reasons such as incorrect configuration of authentication settings, incorrect configuration of web server settings, or issues with the client's browser.
Based on the output of the "netstat -ano" command, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the issue. However, it is possible that an attacker is intercepting traffic between the client and server and stealing user credentials. This type of attack is known as C. ARP poisoning.
ARP poisoning is a type of attack where an attacker sends fake ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network. This allows them to intercept traffic between the two devices and steal sensitive information such as user credentials.

A. Insider threat
B. Hacktivist
C. Nation-state
D. Organized crime
Answer: D
Explanation: 
Organized crime is a term that describes groups of criminals who operate in a coordinated and systematic manner to pursue illicit activities for profit. Organized crime groups often use sophisticated tools and techniques to evade law enforcement and exploit vulnerabilities in various sectors, such as finance, transportation, or healthcare. Organized crime groups may also collaborate with other criminal groups or actors to share resources, information, or expertise. Ransomware as a service (RaaS) is an example of a business model used by organized crime groups to conduct ransomware and extortion attacks. RaaS is an arrangement between an operator, who develops and maintains the tools to power extortion operations, and an affiliate, who deploys the ransomware payload. When the affiliate conducts a successful ransomware and extortion attack, both parties profit. The RaaS model lowers the barrier to entry for attackers who may not have the skill or technical wherewithal to develop their own tools but can manage ready-made penetration testing and sysadmin tools to perform attacks12. Insider threat is a term that describes individuals who have legitimate access to an organization's systems or data and use it for malicious purposes, such as theft, sabotage, or espionage. Insider threats may be motivated by various factors, such as greed, revenge, ideology, or coercion. Insider threats may also be unintentional, such as when an employee falls victim to phishing or social engineering.
Hacktivist is a term that describes individuals or groups who use hacking or cyberattacks to promote a political or social cause. Hacktivists may target governments, corporations, or other entities that they perceive as oppressive, corrupt, or unethical. Hacktivists may also use cyberattacks to expose information, disrupt services, or deface websites.
Nation-state is a term that describes a sovereign state that has a centralized government and a defined territory. Nation-state actors are individuals or groups who conduct cyberattacks on behalf of or with the support of a nation-state. Nation-state actors may target other states, organizations, or individuals for various reasons, such as espionage, sabotage, influence, or retaliation.

Explanation: 
After the root cause of a security incident has been identified, it is important to take the time to analyze what went wrong and how it could have been prevented. This process is known as "lessons learned" and allows organizations to identify potential improvements to their security processes and protocols. Lessons learned typically involve a review of the incident and the steps taken to address it, a review of the security systems and procedures in place, and an analysis of any potential changes that can be made to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
NEW QUESTION 145
- (Exam Topic 2)
A company recently experienced a significant data loss when proprietary information was leaked to a competitor. The company took special precautions by using proper labels; however, email filter logs do not have any record of the incident. An investigation confirmed the corporate network was not breached, but documents were downloaded from an employee's COPE tablet and passed to the competitor via cloud storage. Which of the following is the best mitigation strategy to prevent this from happening in the future?
A. User training
B. CAsB
C. MDM
D. EDR
Answer: C
Explanation: 
MDM stands for mobile device management, which is a solution that allows organizations to manage and secure mobile devices used by employees.

A. Compensating controls
B. Directive control
C. Mitigating controls
D. Physical security controls
Answer: C
Explanation: 
Mitigating controls are designed to reduce the impact or severity of an event that has occurred or is likely to occur. They do not prevent or detect the event, but rather limit the damage or consequences of it. For example, a backup system is a mitigating control that can help restore data after a loss or corruption. In this case, the company is focused on reducing risks from removable media threats, which are threats that can compromise data security, introduce malware infections, or cause media failure123. Removable media threats can be used to bypass network defenses and target industrial/OT environments2. The company cannot prohibit removable media entirely because of certain primary applications that require them, so it implements mitigating controls to lessen the potential harm from these threats.

NEW QUESTION 226
- (Exam Topic 2)
A security analyst is reviewing SIEM logs during an ongoing attack and notices the following: http://company.com/get php? f=/etc/passwd
http://company.com/..%2F. .42 F..42F.. $2Fetct2Fshadow http: //company.com/../../../ ../etc/passwd
Which of the following best describes the type of attack?
A. SQLi
B. CSRF
C. API attacks
D. Directory traversal
Answer: D
Explanation: 
Directory traversal (also known as file path traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include application code and data, credentials for back-end systems, and sensitive operating system files1. In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server1.
Directory traversal in its simplest form uses the .../ pattern, which means to step up one level in the directory structure. By repeating this pattern, an attacker can traverse to the root directory and then access any file or folder on the server. For example, the following request attempts to read the Unix password file /etc/passwd from the server:
http://company.com/get.php?f=/etc/passwd
Some web applications may implement some defenses against directory traversal attacks, such as filtering out
.../ patterns or percent-decoding the user input before validating it. However, these defenses can often be bypassed by using variations or encoding techniques. For example, the following requests use different ways to represent .../ or / characters: http://company.com/...%2F...%2F...%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
http://company.com/.../.../.../%2Fetc%2Fpasswd http://company.com/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/etc/passwd
These requests may still result in directory traversal attacks if the web application does not properly handle them12.
* A. SQLi. This is not the correct answer, because SQLi stands for SQL Injection, which is an attack that exploits a vulnerability in a web application's databaselayer, where malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution3. The requests in the question do not contain any SQL statements or commands.
* B. CSRF. This is not the correct answer, because CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is an attack that exploits the trust a web server has in auser's browser, where malicious requests are sent to the web server using the user's credentials4. The requests in the question do not indicate that they are forged or sent by another website.
* C. API attacks. This is not the correct answer, because API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of rules and specifications that allowsoftware components to communicate and exchange data. API attacks are attacks that target the vulnerabilities or weaknesses of APIs, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, rate limiting, or input validation5. The requests in the question do not target any specific API functionality or feature.
* D. Directory traversal. This is the correct answer, because directory traversal is an attack that exploits insufficient security validation or sanitization of user-supplied file names, such that characters representing "traverse to parent directory" are passed through to the operating system's file system API12. The requests in the question contain various patterns of .../ or / characters that attempt to access restricted files and directories on the server.

A. Encrypted
B. Intellectual property
C. Critical
D. Data in transit
Answer: B
Explanation: 
Intellectual property is a type of data that is proprietary and unique to an organization. It includes trade secrets and other information that the organization does not want to share with third parties or competitors. Employees in the research and development business unit are most likely to use intellectual property in their day-today work activities, as they are involved in creating new products, services, or processes for the organization. Intellectual property data requires a high level of security and protection, as it can provide a competitive advantage or disadvantage if leaked or stolen.
Encrypted data is not a type of data, but a state of data. Encryption is a method of transforming data into an unreadable format using a key, so that only authorized parties can access it. Encryption can be applied to any type of data, such as intellectual property, critical data, or data in transit.
Critical data is a type of data that is essential for the operation and continuity of an organization. It includes information such as customer records, financial transactions, employee details, and so on. Critical data may or may not be intellectual property, depending on the nature and source of the data. Critical data also requires a high level of security and protection, as it can affect the reputation, performance, or legal compliance of the organization.
Data in transit is not a type of data, but a state of data. Data in transit refers to data that is moving from one location to another over a network, such as the internet, a LAN, or a WAN. Data in transit can be vulnerable to interception, modification, or theft by malicious actors. Data in transit can also be any type of data, such as intellectual property, critical data, or PII.

A company has numerous employees who store PHI data locally on devices. The Chief Information Officer wants to implement a solution to reduce external exposure of PHI but not affect the business.
The first step the IT team should perform is to deploy a DLP solution:
A. for only data in transit.
B. for only data at reset.
C. in blocking mode.
D. in monitoring mode.
Answer: D
Explanation: 
A DLP solution in monitoring mode is a good first step to deploy for data loss prevention. It allows the IT team to observe and analyze the data flows and activities without blocking or interfering with them. It helps to identify the sources and destinations of sensitive data, the types and volumes of data involved, and the potential risks and violations. It also helps to fine-tune the DLP policies and rules before switching to blocking mode, which can disrupt business operations if not configured properly.

A systems administrator is required to enforce MFA for corporate email account access, relying on the possession factor. Which of the following authentication methods should the systems administrator choose? (Select two).
A. passphrase
B. Time-based one-time password
C. Facial recognition
D. Retina scan
E. Hardware token
F. Fingerprints
Answer: BE
Explanation: 
Time-based one-time password (TOTP) and hardware token are authentication methods that rely on the possession factor, which means that the user must have a specific device or object in their possession to authenticate. A TOTP is a password that is valid for a short period of time and is generated by an app or a device that the user has. A hardware token is a physical device that displays a code or a password that the user can enter to authenticate. A passphrase (Option A) is a knowledge factor, while facial recognition (Option C), retina scan (Option D), and fingerprints (Option F) are all inherence factors. https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/pearsonitcertification/bookreg/9780136798675/97801367 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCJyPPvM-xg

An organization has been experiencing outages during holiday sales and needs to ensure availability of its point-of-sales systems. The IT administrator has been asked to improve both server-data fault tolerance and site availability under high consumer load. Which of the following are the best options to accomplish this objective? (Select two.)
A. Load balancing
B. Incremental backups
C. UPS
D. RAID
E. Dual power supply
F. VLAN
Answer: AD
Explanation: 
Load balancing and RAID are the best options to accomplish the objective of improving both server-data fault tolerance and site availability under high consumer load. Load balancing is a method of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance, reliability, and scalability. Load balancing can help improve site availability by preventing server overload, ensuring high uptime, and providing redundancy and failover. RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks, which is a technology that combines multiple physical disks into a logical unit to improve data storage performance, reliability, and capacity.
RAID can help improve server-data fault tolerance by providing data redundancy, backup, and recovery.

Which of the following is used to quantitatively measure the criticality of a vulnerability?
A. CVE
B. CVSS
C. CIA
D. CERT
Answer: B
Explanation: 
The correct answer is B. CVSS.
CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System. It is a framework that provides a standardized way to measure the criticality of a vulnerability based on various factors, such as the impact, exploitability, and remediation level of the vulnerability. CVSS assigns a numerical score from 0 to 10 to each vulnerability, where 0 means no risk and 10 means the highest risk. CVSS also provides a qualitative rating for each score, such as low, medium, high, or critical. CVSS helps organizations prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact12.
CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a list of publicly known and standardized identifiers for vulnerabilities and exposures in software and hardware systems. CVE provides a brief description of each vulnerability or exposure, but does not assign a score or rating to them. CVE helps organizations communicate and share information about vulnerabilities and exposures in a consistent and reliable way3 .
CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It is a model that defines the three main objectives of information security. Confidentiality means protecting data from unauthorized access or disclosure. Integrity means ensuring data is accurate and consistent and has not been tampered with. Availability means ensuring data is accessible and usable by authorized parties when needed. CIA helps organizations design and implement security controls and policies to protect their data and systems .
CERT stands for Computer Emergency Response Team. It is a group of experts who respond to security incidents and provide guidance and assistance to mitigate and prevent cyberattacks. CERT also conducts research and analysis on cybersecurity trends and issues, and disseminates information and best practices to the public. CERT helps organizations improve their security posture and resilience against cyber threats .

A network administrator needs to determine the sequence of a server farm's logs. Which of the following should the administrator consider? (Select two).
A. Chain of custody
B. Tags
C. Reports
D. Time stamps
E. Hash values
F. Time offset
Answer: DF
Explanation: 
A server farm's logs are records of events that occur on a group of servers that provide the same service or function. Logs can contain information such as date, time, source, destination, message, error code, and severity level. Logs can help administrators monitor the performance, security, and availability of the servers and troubleshoot any issues.
To determine the sequence of a server farm's logs, the administrator should consider the following factors:
• Time stamps: Time stamps are indicators of when an event occurred on a server. Time stamps can help administrators sort and correlate events acrossdifferent servers based on chronological order. However, time stamps alone may not be sufficient to determine the sequence of events if the servers have different time zones or clock settings.
• Time offset: Time offset is the difference between the local time of a server and a reference time, such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or GreenwichMean Time (GMT). Time offset can help administrators adjust and synchronize the time stamps of different servers to a common reference time and eliminate any discrepancies caused by time zones or clock settings.
